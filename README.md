 # Project Title: Coffee Shop Sales Analysis


## Project Overview
This data analysis project is aim to generate insights into the total sales and product performance from a coffee shop and its franchise. Using the various parameters given to analyze, we seek to gather various insights to make compelling insights to make decisions that will improve the performance of the coffee.

## Data Sources
The data source is an excel csv. file obtained from mavin analytic.io. This file contains information like, Transaction id, transaction time, transaction date, product id, product category, etc... 

## Tools Used
Microsoft Excel for data gathering, data preparation and data analysis

Git Hub for portfolio building

## Objectives

Data Preparation: Profile and Prepare data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform basic exploratory data analysis with pivot tables.

Visualizations: Build a dynamic dashboard to visualize patterns and trends

## Project Structure

1. Data Preparation

Data is prepared by importing the csv file on Excel to understand the data and perform various task like

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the data. How many transactions were
recorded, over what period of time? What products and product categories were sold?
Add a new column to calculate Revenue (price quantity)
Add new columns to calculate Month and Day of Week based on the transaction date
(BONUS: display them as text (i.e. "Jan", "Feb", "Sun", "Mon"), instead of numerical values)
VAdd a new column to extract Hour from the transaction time




2. Data Exploration & Cleaning
Insert a PivotTable on a new tab to show revenue by month
Add two more PivotTables (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by day of
week and by hour of day
Add a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by product
category. sorted descending by transactions
Add a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions and revenue by
product type, sorted descending and filtered to the Top 15 (by transactions)

3. Visualizations
Add Pivot Charts to show revenue by month as a line chart, transactions by day of week
and hour of day as column charts, and transactions by product category as a bar chart
Assemble the charts into a rough dashboard layout, and include space for the PivotTable
showing Top 15 product types (you can design your own layout, or follow the solution)
VAdd a slicer for store location, and connect it to all of the PivotTables on the sheet
Adjust formatting. alignment and polish to finalize the dashboard (TIP: hide the raw
PivotTables and remove the worksheet gridlines!)
Do you notice any interesting patterns or trends? What recommendations might you offer to
improve Maven Roasters operations?

## Conclusion/Recommendations 

This project has highlighted some insights into customers interest and time of purchase. Products like should stop being sold so as to save money and channel the income in the purchase of more Coffee. 
Lower Manhattan and would have to close early in other to save up operations cost as less sales are made by 7PM AND 8PM. Lower Manhattan would have to produce less coffee or products during the weekend, and use more of the resources on Monday.
Generally, should be less in quantity as they have limited sales in all stores. 

This project shows how data analysis can project lapses from this coffee stores and provide ways the various stores can be more efficient and productive, by reducing liabilities and investing in more assets to boost sales.
